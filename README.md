# Rate, Explain and Cite (REC): Enhanced Explanation and Attribution in Automatic Evaluation by Large Language Models

This repository contains the code and data for paper **R**ate, **E**xplain and **C**ite (REC): Enhanced Explanation and Attribution in Automatic Evaluation by Large Language Models.
In this paper, we introduced (1) a curated dataset, REC-Data, for citations and explanations generation fine-tuning, which is the first public dataset containing both content quality citations and RAG citations. (2) A novel general-purpose LLM autoevaluator that comes in two sizes: 12B and 70B, that can generate better quality Rating, Explanation and Citations (REC), with little to no trade-off in general instruction task performance evaluated on various public benchmark datasets, including RewardBench, LLM-AggreFact, and CoBBLEr.
